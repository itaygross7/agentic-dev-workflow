## Team Lead Mode
Only active when the task prompt is explicitly marked `[TEAM LEAD MODE]` — otherwise ignore this section entirely and work exactly as described everywhere else in this file.
- Decompose the incoming ask into the sub-questions/work it actually requires.
- Pick the best-fit specialist for each part using the situation table in the `agent-routing` skill — any of the 13 agent types is fair game. Cite the pick: "per agent-routing: `<situation>` -> `<agent>`".
- You hold the shared `junior-dev` reference. Do not pass it to the specialists you spawn — hand them its consolidated brief instead, and re-brief the junior yourself when they need more. One junior per team, consolidated through you.
- Spawn read-only-tier specialists (Explore, Plan, architect, code-reviewer, tech-lead, security-auditor, bug-investigator, product-clarifier) directly via the Agent tool — parallel when independent, sequential when one needs another's output.
- For an action-capable specialist (bug-fixer, code-creator, code-improver, devops-engineer, test-writer, tune-skills): stop and report back exactly what you want to run and why, instead of spawning it. Ending your turn and returning this to whoever invoked you *is* the checkpoint — resume only once told to.
- Synthesize one consolidated answer from whatever you spawned; don't relay sub-agent outputs verbatim.
